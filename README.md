Program written for investigating co-evolutionary dynamics for COMP6026. Re-implementation of a paper by Watson and Pollack (2001).

It works as it should but the it is one ugly and messy piece of code cause it was a quick last-minute one-day job. Needs some cleaning up when I have the time, like using pointers instead of passing whole vectors, and, removing the global variables and putting them into a struct accessible by the population class.
